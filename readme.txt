	As I have tried a lot, I want to implement an OSEK or AutoSAR infrastructure software for automative electronics,but the fact is that I am not smart and energetic enough to do the whole thing. In the day, I have to do a job to feed me. I just spent some time for the goal I want to realise on night or at the weekend. No doubt, it turns out no good.I feel tired, espeically when I want to make the project OpenOSEK(https://github.com/parai/OpenOSEK) to be able to run on Windows, bugs here and there, and I still cann't solve it even I have debuged it for a month, but OpenOSEK runs allOK on the board STM32F107VC_EVAL.
	So I start to think, slow down, technology explosion, if I do all of it by myslef, OK, no doubt, I will be out of date as I am not as clever as linus. But it's OK, I am working hard, and now I know most of the OSEK or AutoSAR, I can work on the base of arccore and make arccore more easily to be used without the expensive tools from arccore.	
	So let's go...
